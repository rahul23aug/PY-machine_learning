# PY-machine_learning
This repository is created with the aim of implementing most (if not all) of the machine learning models without using machine learning libraries.
can be helpful for beginners since it strips away the abstraction thats being done by ML libraries
this repository will be written in jupyter notebook.
while keeping a view of creating: Data wrangling tools,ML algos,optimization algos, validation tools etc
